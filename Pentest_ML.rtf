Currently, machine learning techniques are some of the hottest trends in information technology. They impact every aspect of our lives, and they affect every industry and field. Machine learning is a cyber weapon for information security professionals. In this book, readers will not only explore the fundamentals behind machine learning techniques, but will also learn the secrets to building a fully functional machine learning security system. We will not stop at building defensive layers; we will illustrate how to build offensive tools to attack and bypass security defenses. By the end of this book, you will be able to bypass machine learning security systems and use the models constructed in penetration testing (pentesting) missions.

In this chapter, we will cover:

Machine learning models and algorithms
Performance evaluation metrics
- Machine learning models and algorithms
	- models are divided, based on datasets entered (input), into four major categories:
		1. supervised learning
		2. semi-supervised learning
		3. unsupervised learning
		4. reinforcement
- Performance evaluation metrics
- Dimensionality reduction
- Ensemble learning
- Machine learning in penetration testing – promises and challenges
- Machine learning development environments and Python libraries

We are going to build a development environment. Therefore, we are going to install the following Python machine learning libraries:

- NumPy
	- pip install numpy

- SciPy
	- https://www.scipy.org/getting-started.html

- TensorFlow
	- https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/
	- mkdir TF-project
	- virtualenv --system-site-packages TF-project
	- source  <Directory_Here>/bin/activate
	- pip install -upgrade tensorflow

- Keras
	- Keras is a widely used Python library for building deep learning models.
		It is so easy, because it is built on top of TensorFlow. The best way to
		build deep learning models is to follow the previously discussed steps:
			1. Loading data
			2. Defining the model
			3. Compiling the model
			4. Fitting
			5. Evaluation
			6. Prediction
	- pip install keras
	- check version
		- python
		- import keras
		- print keras.__version__

- pandas
	- pip install pandas

- MatplotLib
	- https://matplotlib.org


- scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Theano
